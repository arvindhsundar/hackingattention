Hi! I'm Arvindh Sundar, and welcome to Hacking Attention.

This site is a collection of my notes as I explore the answers to two questions that have been central to my career and personal life:

> 1. What does it take to capture, hold and direct attention?
> 2. How can we retain control over our attention?

Apart from these answers, there will be tangents that I find interesting, giving a chance for happy little accidents. I invite you to see where my explorations have taken me.

A few pointers:
- The notes are written for me. The detail depends on my preferred [Working Resolution](Working%20Resolution.md) or interest in the topic.
- The notes will change over time.
- Some of you may prefer to see my [Areas of Exploration](Areas%20of%20Exploration.md), my [Note Taking](Note%20Taking.md) process, [My Learning Process](My%20Learning%20Process.md) or the concept of [Learning](Learning.md).

If you want to reach me, hit me up on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/arvindhsundar).

With love from Bengaluru, this is Arvindh saying over and out.
