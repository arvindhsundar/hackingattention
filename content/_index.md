Hi! I'm Arvindh Sundar, and welcome to Hacking Attention.

This site is a collection of my notes as I explore the answers to two questions that have been central to my career and personal life:

> 1. What does it take to capture, hold and direct attention?
> 2. How can we retain control over our attention?

Apart from these answers, there will be tangents that I find interesting, giving a chance for happy little accidents.

I invite you to see where my explorations have taken me. Start by visiting my [Areas of Exploration](Areas%20of%20Exploration.md) or clicking about on the graph below. (There will be more notes as my notes grow!)

If you want to reach me, hit me up on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/arvindhsundar).

With love from Bengaluru, this is Arvindh saying over and out.
