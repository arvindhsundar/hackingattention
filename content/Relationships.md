# Relationships

In the context of [Learning](Learning.md), Relationships indicate how two [Atomic Ideas](Atomic%20Ideas.md) are related. 

Two or more [Atomic Ideas](Atomic%20Ideas.md) with a defined relationship form a [Concept](Concept.md). Relationships are often identified in the [Rebuild](Rebuild.md) and [Translation](Translation.md) stages of [My Learning Process](My%20Learning%20Process.md).

This definition can be used to test if an idea is truly an Atomic Idea or a Concept that bears breaking down. 

Of course, it's perfectly ok to deal in concepts instead of atomic ideas, as long as it matches your [Working Resolution](Working%20Resolution.md).
