# Relationships

In the context of [[Learning]], Relationships indicate how two [[Atomic Ideas]] are related. 

Two or more [[Atomic Ideas]] with a defined relationship form a [[Concept]]. Relationships are often identified in the [[Rebuild]] and [[Translation]] stages of [[My Learning Process]].

This definition can be used to test if an idea is truly an Atomic Idea or a Concept that bears breaking down. 

Of course, it's perfectly ok to deal in concepts instead of atomic ideas, as long as it matches your [[Working Resolution]].
