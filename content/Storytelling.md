Storytelling is an artform as old as civilization. 

Various frameworks for storytelling exist, with each story beat focusing on a specific [Inflection point](Inflection%20point.md) in the story.

Creators use the structures/formulae for stories as audiences are subconsciously comfortable with the structure - and subconsciously give the story attention. 

That's why Kung Fu Panda & Harry Potter & The Matrix have similar plotlines.

However, many people [complain](complain.md) that using a formula or framework for storytelling kills [creativity](creativity.md).

The fact that a formula exists also means that a creator can use a twist to subvert that expectation - and use [surprise](surprise) to gain attention.
