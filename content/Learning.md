## Learning
Learning is the act of increasing your understanding a topic or subject. 

A good end goal of learning is to understand the [Unity and Complexity](Unity%20and%20Complexity.md) of a topic. Without it, you risk [Intellectual Regurgitation](Intellectual%20Regurgitation.md) - but, it can be overcome by [Active Consumption](Active%20Consumption.md).

There are other ways you can make that happen, but my preferred approach is to apply a modified version of the [Feynman Technique](Feynman%20Technique.md) as [My Learning Process](My%20Learning%20Process.md).

## My Learning Process
Without [tearing something down](Teardown%20) to [Atomic Ideas](Atomic%20Ideas.md) and rebuilding it in your own way, you have not learned anything. This process of requires you to [translate what you've learned](Translation.md) and [store them into new nodes](Knowledge%20Storage.md) of your [Mesh of Understanding](Mesh%20of%20Understanding.md).

This is outlined in [My Learning Process](My%20Learning%20Process.md).
