Learning is the act of increasing your understanding something. 

A good end goal of learning is to understand the [Unity and Complexity](Unity%20and%20Complexity.md) of a topic. Without it, you risk [Intellectual Regurgitation](Intellectual%20Regurgitation.md).

Without tearing something down ([Teardown](Teardown.md)) and rebuilding it in your own way, you have not learned anything. 

This process of requires you to translate what you've learned ([Translation](Translation.md)) and store them into new nodes ([Knowledge Storage](Knowledge%20Storage.md)) of your [Mesh of Understanding](Mesh%20of%20Understanding.md).

This is outlined in [My Learning Process](My%20Learning%20Process.md).
