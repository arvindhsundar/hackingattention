## Learning
Learning is the act of increasing your understanding a topic or subject. 

A good end goal of learning is to understand the [[Unity and Complexity]] of a topic. Without it, you risk [[Intellectual Regurgitation]] - but, it can be overcome by [[Active Consumption]].

There are other ways you can make that happen, but my preferred approach is to apply a modified version of the [[Feynman Technique]] as [[My Learning Process]].

## My Learning Process
Without [[Teardown |tearing something down]] to [[Atomic Ideas]] and rebuilding it in your own way, you have not learned anything. This process of requires you to [[Translation|translate what you've learned]] and [[Knowledge Storage|store them into new nodes]] of your [[Mesh of Understanding]].

This is outlined in [[My Learning Process]].
