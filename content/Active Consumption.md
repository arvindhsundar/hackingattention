# Active Consumption
Most consumption is passive: We lean back and let the information wash over us. However, if we actively engage with the content, we tend to retain a lot more. 

However, all consumption does not need to be active. You can consume something for knowledge or entertainment as well.

## How To Consume Actively
The simplest ways to consume something actively is to [rip it apart](Teardown.md) and [put it back together](Rebuild.md)  or by asking [Explosive Questions](Explosive%20Questions.md) to get to the [Atomic Ideas](Atomic%20Ideas.md) contained within.

My favourite fictional example is the marginalia that Severus Snape writes in his potions textbook in the Half Blood Prince by JK Rowling.


## Why Bother With Active Consumption?
Doing this also helps us place items in our [Mesh of Understanding](Mesh%20of%20Understanding.md) and the [relationships](Relationships.md) that may arise by reviewing it.

This process also increases the odds of avoiding [Intellectual Regurgitation](Intellectual%20Regurgitation.md).
