title: "Active Consumption"
---
Most consumption is passive: We lean back and let the information wash over us. However, if we actively engage with the content, we tend to retain a lot more. This also helps us avoid [Intellectual Regurgitation](Intellectual%20Regurgitation.md).

However, all consumption does not need to be active. You can consume something for knowledge or entertainment as well.

## How To Consume Actively
The simplest ways to consume something actively is to rip it apart ([Teardown](Teardown.md)) and put it back together ([Rebuild](Rebuild.md)), as outlined in [My Learning Process](My%20Learning%20Process.md).
