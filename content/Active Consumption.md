# Active Consumption
Most consumption is passive: We lean back and let the information wash over us. However, if we actively engage with the content, we tend to retain a lot more. 

However, all consumption does not need to be active. You can consume something for knowledge or entertainment as well.

## How To Consume Actively
The simplest ways to consume something actively is to [[Teardown|rip it apart]] and [[Rebuild|put it back together]]  or by asking [[Explosive Questions]] to get to the [[Atomic Ideas]] contained within.

My favourite fictional example is the marginalia that Severus Snape writes in his potions textbook in the Half Blood Prince by JK Rowling.


## Why Bother With Active Consumption?
Doing this also helps us place items in our [[Mesh of Understanding]] and the [[Relationships|relationships]] that may arise by reviewing it.

This process also increases the odds of avoiding [[Intellectual Regurgitation]].
