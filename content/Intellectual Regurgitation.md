# Intellectual Regurgitation
In an effort to sound smart, people participate in intellectual regurgitation: taking [[prepackaged opinions]] and pass it off as their own, bypassing the [[thinking required to form an opinion]]. 

This is also one of the techniques people use to [[Signal]] their core attributes.

## Why does Intellectual Regurgitation happen?
Our [[brain]] has evolved into its current state by optimizing for survival - and that usually means spending as little energy as possible.

Thinking for ourselves takes time, effort and energy - and our brain does not like spending energy.
