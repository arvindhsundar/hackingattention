# Discovery
Discovery is exposure to a new entity - an idea, concept, emotion, movement - anything.

## Types of Discovery
Discovery can be: 
1. Aided: A [[Inbox/Guide]] teaches you something new.
2. Unaided: You pursue a thread of research based on your understanding of the world, usually to increase the [[Working Resolution|resolution]], driven by curiosity or serendipity.
3. Guided: Your [[Mesh of Understanding]] has gaps that you want to fill.

If I'm [[Reading]] to learn the process of Discovery is followed by [[Teardown]].
