Discovery is exposure to a new entity - an idea, concept, emotion, movement - anything.

## Types of Discovery
Discovery can be: 
1. Aided: A guide or teacher teaches you something new.
2. Unaided: You pursue a thread of research based on your understanding of the world, usually to increase the [Working Resolution](Working%20Resolution.md), driven by curiosity or serendipity.
3. Guided: Your [Mesh of Understanding](Mesh%20of%20Understanding.md) has gaps that you want to fill.

The process of Discovery is followed by [Teardown](Teardown.md).
