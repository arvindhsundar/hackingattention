# Atomic Ideas
An Atomic Idea is the fundamental unit of understanding and [Learning](Learning.md) - the permanently understandable note. [My Learning Process](My%20Learning%20Process.md) involves the creation of [Atomic Ideas](.md) in the [Translation](Translation.md) and [Rebuild](Rebuild.md) phases.

Multiple atomic ideas are linked together by [Relationships](Relationships.md) to form a [Concept](Concept.md). By extension, Atomic Ideas are the nodes in my [Mesh of Understanding](Mesh%20of%20Understanding.md).

## To Explore
What is the relationship between [Working Resolution](Working%20Resolution.md) and [Atomic Ideas](.md)? Does the atomicity of the idea change with the working resolution?
