Translation is the process of understanding the author or creator's intent and putting it forward in our own words - often into [Atomic Ideas](Atomic%20Ideas.md) or [Concept](Concept.md), depending on the [Working Resolution](Working%20Resolution.md).


This forces us to understand - the true essence of [Learning](Learning.md). This also allows us to grok the [Unity and Complexity](Unity%20and%20Complexity.md) of a topic

## Tools of Translation
### Analogies
Analogies are powerful tools when it comes to translation because you need to be well versed in the inner workings of both the source and destination [concepts](Concept.md) to make an accurate translation.

Example: A good piece of content is like a house. Structure and usability of each room adds to the overall value of the house - just like each section of a piece of content adds to its overall value.  

### Vocabulary
In this step, it is important to create our own vocabulary and terminology for concepts and ideas, separate from the creator to reduce the chances of us adopting their opinion as our own - a form of [Intellectual Regurgitation](Intellectual%20Regurgitation.md).

## Note Taking
[Note Taking](Note%20Taking.md) is the backbone of   [My Learning Process](My%20Learning%20Process.md) - and the creation of notes requires Translation.
