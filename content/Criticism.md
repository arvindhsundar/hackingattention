# Criticism
Criticism is the act of extending your [[Learning|understanding]] by establishing a [[Relationships|relationship]] between an idea you [[Discovery|discovered]] and any other existing [[Atomic Ideas|idea]] or [[Concept]] in your [[Mesh of Understanding]].

Criticism can take one of three paths:

1. I agree.
2. I disagree.
3. I suspend judgement

You can extend these remarks by adding:
- and
- but
- so
- because etc.
