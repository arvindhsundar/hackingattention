# Criticism
Criticism is the act of extending your [understanding](Learning.md) by establishing a [relationship](Relationships.md) between an idea you [discovered](Discovery.md) and any other existing [idea](Atomic%20Ideas.md) or [Concept](Concept.md) in your [Mesh of Understanding](Mesh%20of%20Understanding.md).

Criticism can take one of three paths:

1. I agree.
2. I disagree.
3. I suspend judgement

You can extend these remarks by adding:
- and
- but
- so
- because etc.
