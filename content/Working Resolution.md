# Working Resolution
In any situation, there is a threshold of information required for meaningful engagement, defined by the context in which we are operating. 

If the information we have falls short, we cannot engage effectively. If we have excessive information, we may not use it - or worse, get detracted.

This threshold of information is called The Working Resolution.

The Working Resolution changes from task to task, depending on the context in which we are operating.


## Example of Working Resolution
To drive a car, we don't need to know how a car is built.
To build a car, we don't need to know how steel is made.

## Working Resolution and Expertise
If you're looking to cultivate [depth](Deep%20Expertise), then it would be beneficial to build up [Working Resolution](.md) to a great level of fidelity.

If you're looking to cultivate [breadth](Systems%20Expertise), then it would be beneficial to build up your knowledge of [Relationships](Relationships.md) across a number of different [Concept](Concept.md) at a lower working resolution
