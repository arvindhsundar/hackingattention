# Reasoning
Reasoning is the process of constructing [Arguments](Arguments.md) to provide [Proof](Proof.md) for a [Proposition](Proposition.md).

## Inductive Reasoning
Some [Arguments](Arguments.md) build upon observed facts to arrive at a generalization. This is called Inductive Reasoning.

Inductive Research is conducted when there is no [theory](Models.md) to test.


## Deductive Reasoning
Some [Arguments](Arguments.md) build upon a theory to prove further generalizations. This is called Deductive Reasoning.

Deductive Research is conducted to test the [theories](Models.md) we have formed.
