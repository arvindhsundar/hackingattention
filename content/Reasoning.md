# Reasoning
Reasoning is the process of constructing [[Arguments]] to provide [[Proof]] for a [[Proposition]].

## Inductive Reasoning
Some [[Arguments]] build upon observed facts to arrive at a generalization. This is called Inductive Reasoning.

Inductive Research is conducted when there is no [[Models|theory]] to test.


## Deductive Reasoning
Some [[Arguments]] build upon a theory to prove further generalizations. This is called Deductive Reasoning.

Deductive Research is conducted to test the [[Models|theories]] we have formed.
