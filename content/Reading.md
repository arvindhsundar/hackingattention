Reading is how most of us find new things ([Discovery](Discovery.md)) and learn them.

However, not all reading is the same. You can read for fun, for knowledge or for [Learning](Learning.md). The difference between these is how actively you consume ([Active Consumption](Active%20Consumption.md)) the content.
