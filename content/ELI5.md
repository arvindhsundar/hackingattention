title: "ELI5"

This is a learning technique where you explain something to someone as if they were a five year old. This forces you to understand the topic well enough that you can simplify it for somebody else.

This is closely related to the [Feynman Technique](Feynman%20Technique.md) - and a modified version forms a critical part of [My Learning Process](My%20Learning%20Process.md).
