title: "Signal"
---

A signal is a way for an entity to convey something to another entity. 

The world runs on signals and often, signals are used to short circuit our processing and understanding of the world.

[Noise](Noise.md) is a signal that detracts from the ultimate [Message](Message.md) you want to convey and the [Reputation](Reputation.md) you want to build.

Entities often consciously choose the signals they send out to develop a certain [Reputation](Reputation.md) or [Brand](Brand.md).

Everyone is looking to boost their [Signal to Noise Ratio](Signal%20to%20Noise%20Ratio.md).
