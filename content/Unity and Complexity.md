# Unity & Complexity
To truly [[Learning|understand]] something, we need to follow [[My Learning Process]]. This allows us to understand how the individual pieces - the [[Atomic Ideas]] work - the "complexity" and how the whole [[Concept]], "the unity" works.

I like to visualize the [[Relationships|relationship]] between a tree and a forest as a way to [[Translation|translate]] the relationship between [[.md|Unity and Complexity]].


## Trivia
I first encountered this concept in Adler and Doren, _How to Read a Book_.
