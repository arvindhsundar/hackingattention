# Unity & Complexity
To truly [understand](Learning.md) something, we need to follow [My Learning Process](My%20Learning%20Process.md). This allows us to understand how the individual pieces - the [Atomic Ideas](Atomic%20Ideas.md) work - the "complexity" and how the whole [Concept](Concept.md), "the unity" works.

I like to visualize the [relationship](Relationships.md) between a tree and a forest as a way to [translate](Translation.md) the relationship between [Unity and Complexity](.md).


## Trivia
I first encountered this concept in Adler and Doren, _How to Read a Book_.
