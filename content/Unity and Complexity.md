title: "Unity and Complexity"
---
To truly |understand something, I need to follow [My Learning Process](My%20Learning%20Process.md). This allows me to understand how the individual pieces - the [Atomic Idea](Atomic%20Idea.md)s work - the "complexity" and how the whole [Concept](Concept.md), "the unity" works.

I like to visualize the [Relationships](Relationships.md) between a tree and a forest as a way to translate ([Translation](Translation.md)) the relationship between Unity and Complexity.
