title: "Feynman Technique"
---
This is a technique developed by Richard Feynman to make sure he understood the [Unity and Complexity](Unity%20and%20Complexity.md) of a topic.

There are 4 steps:
1. Learn about a topic.
2. Prepare and develop an introductory lecture on the topic suitable for a 12 year old.
3. Simplify it by eliminating jargon, breaking down complicated concepts and clarifying confusion.
4. Organize it and review it with a regular cadence.

I use a modified version of it in [My Learning Process](My%20Learning%20Process.md)
