# Feynman Technique

This is a technique developed by Richard Feynman to make sure he understood [something fully](Unity%20and%20Complexity.md).

There are 4 steps:

1. Learn about a topic.
2. Prepare and develop an introductory lecture on the topic suitable for a 12 year old.
3. Simplify it by eliminating jargon, breaking down complicated concepts and clarifying confusion.
4. Organize it and review it with a regular cadence.

[My Learning Process](My%20Learning%20Process.md) builds on the Feynman Technique by adding the [Discovery](Discovery.md) stage, as well as expanding on the simplifying stage through [Translation](Translation.md).
