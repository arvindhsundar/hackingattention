# Note Taking
Note taking is a powerful [[Mechanisms of Learning|way to learn]] and build a [[Mesh of Understanding]].

Summmarized below is the mechanical way I execute [[My Learning Process]]. This is heavily inspired by [[How To Read A Book]], Andy Matuschak's [Evergreen Notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes?stackedNotes=z4SDCZQeRo4xFEQ8H4qrSqd68ucpgE6LU155C), Niklas Luhmann's [Zettelkasten](http://luhmann.surge.sh/communicating-with-slip-boxes) and Sonke Ahrens' [How To Take Smart notes](https://takesmartnotes.com/)


## The Process
My Note Taking process has 5 steps:
1. Collecting notes.
2. Creating notes.
3. Connecting notes.
4. Reviewing notes.
5. Synthesis.

### 1. Collecting Notes
Whenever an idea or inspiration strikes me, I take "fleeting notes" in index cards, my phone, a text file or a handy notebook. 

Whenever I consume something interesting, I take "literature notes". I also record the bibliographic details.

This collection of notes happens in the [[Discovery]] phase of my learning process.

### 2. Creating Notes

Once a day, I process all my fleeting and literature notes to create a [[Atomic Ideas]] for each unique idea I've encountered. This is the [[Teardown]] stage of [[My Learning Process]].

Sometimes, these may be [[Concept|concepts]] and sometimes, depending on the [[Working Resolution]], I can break them down to the [[Atomic Ideas]] contained within.

I write it as if I was teaching someone, in my own words. This is the process of [[Translation]], similar to the essence of the [[Feynman Technique]].

These notes remain in the [[The Inbox]] till they're complete and ready for further action.

Once processed, I delete the fleeting notes & archive the literature notes.

### 3. Connecting Notes
To connect my [[Atomic Ideas|permanote]] and add it into my second brain, I figure out where it fits into my overall mesh/map of knowledge and the [[Relationships]] to other [[Atomic Ideas|notes]] and [[Concept|concepts]].

This allows me to [[Rebuild]] my understanding of the [[Atomic Ideas]], the [[Concept]] and the [[Relationships]] that exist within the [[Unity and Complexity]] of the topic at hand.

The goal is to add value to what I already have - not repeat what I already have/know - i.e. avoid [[Intellectual Regurgitation]].

Once I've found the right place, I [[Knowledge Storage|add it into my second brain system]] and link it:

1.  To the note it is closest to conceptually with text explaining the [[Relationships]] between the two.
2.  Link it to other relevant notes as well.

Sometimes, if it's a new topic, I'll have to make it an island - a note that's not connected to anything else. 

### 4. Reviewing Notes
Periodically, I review my second brain, thanks to a recurring calendar event - and a random note plugin in Obsidian. I look at the connections and gaps to ask new questions go down another rabbit hole.

As my body of notes ([[Mesh of Understanding]]) grows, I will need to create "staging notes" which contain links to other "launchpad notes" that serve as entry points to a particular sector of knowledge.

### 5. Synthesis
Once the body of notes has grown large enough, I'll look for a many notes clustered around a topic. I can then collate those notes to form an outline for a new piece of content. 

Once I have the outline, all I'll need to do is edit that manuscript and publish.


## Tools for Note Taking
The tools I use for this process are:

1. Index cards or my phone to take fleeting notes.
2. Sometimes, I use the highlight feature as well in my book reading app for literature notes.
3. @obsdmd to build my second brain.
4. @Zotero to maintain bibliographies.
