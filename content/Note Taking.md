# Note Taking
Note taking is a powerful [way to learn](Mechanisms%20of%20Learning.md) and build a [Mesh of Understanding](Mesh%20of%20Understanding.md).

Summmarized below is the mechanical way I execute [My Learning Process](My%20Learning%20Process.md). This is heavily inspired by [How To Read A Book](How%20To%20Read%20A%20Book.md), Andy Matuschak's [Evergreen Notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes?stackedNotes=z4SDCZQeRo4xFEQ8H4qrSqd68ucpgE6LU155C), Niklas Luhmann's [Zettelkasten](http://luhmann.surge.sh/communicating-with-slip-boxes) and Sonke Ahrens' [How To Take Smart notes](https://takesmartnotes.com/)


## The Process
My Note Taking process has 5 steps:
1. Collecting notes.
2. Creating notes.
3. Connecting notes.
4. Reviewing notes.
5. Synthesis.

### 1. Collecting Notes
Whenever an idea or inspiration strikes me, I take "fleeting notes" in index cards, my phone, a text file or a handy notebook. 

Whenever I consume something interesting, I take "literature notes". I also record the bibliographic details.

This collection of notes happens in the [Discovery](Discovery.md) phase of my learning process.

### 2. Creating Notes

Once a day, I process all my fleeting and literature notes to create a [Atomic Ideas](Atomic%20Ideas.md) for each unique idea I've encountered. This is the [Teardown](Teardown.md) stage of [My Learning Process](My%20Learning%20Process.md).

Sometimes, these may be [concepts](Concept.md) and sometimes, depending on the [Working Resolution](Working%20Resolution.md), I can break them down to the [Atomic Ideas](Atomic%20Ideas.md) contained within.

I write it as if I was teaching someone, in my own words. This is the process of [Translation](Translation.md), similar to the essence of the [Feynman Technique](Feynman%20Technique.md).

These notes remain in the [The Inbox](The%20Inbox.md) till they're complete and ready for further action.

Once processed, I delete the fleeting notes & archive the literature notes.

### 3. Connecting Notes
To connect my [permanote](Atomic%20Ideas.md) and add it into my second brain, I figure out where it fits into my overall mesh/map of knowledge and the [Relationships](Relationships.md) to other [notes](Atomic%20Ideas.md) and [concepts](Concept.md).

This allows me to [Rebuild](Rebuild.md) my understanding of the [Atomic Ideas](Atomic%20Ideas.md), the [Concept](Concept.md) and the [Relationships](Relationships.md) that exist within the [Unity and Complexity](Unity%20and%20Complexity.md) of the topic at hand.

The goal is to add value to what I already have - not repeat what I already have/know - i.e. avoid [Intellectual Regurgitation](Intellectual%20Regurgitation.md).

Once I've found the right place, I [add it into my second brain system](Knowledge%20Storage.md) and link it:

1.  To the note it is closest to conceptually with text explaining the [Relationships](Relationships.md) between the two.
2.  Link it to other relevant notes as well.

Sometimes, if it's a new topic, I'll have to make it an island - a note that's not connected to anything else. 

### 4. Reviewing Notes
Periodically, I review my second brain, thanks to a recurring calendar event - and a random note plugin in Obsidian. I look at the connections and gaps to ask new questions go down another rabbit hole.

As my body of notes ([Mesh of Understanding](Mesh%20of%20Understanding.md)) grows, I will need to create "staging notes" which contain links to other "launchpad notes" that serve as entry points to a particular sector of knowledge.

### 5. Synthesis
Once the body of notes has grown large enough, I'll look for a many notes clustered around a topic. I can then collate those notes to form an outline for a new piece of content. 

Once I have the outline, all I'll need to do is edit that manuscript and publish.


## Tools for Note Taking
The tools I use for this process are:

1. Index cards or my phone to take fleeting notes.
2. Sometimes, I use the highlight feature as well in my book reading app for literature notes.
3. @obsdmd to build my second brain.
4. @Zotero to maintain bibliographies.
