title: "Explosive Questions"

Also called the 6 Horsemen, **who, what, when, where, why and how** are 6 powerful questions we can use to explode & explore the topic at hand.

These questions give us distinct lenses to look at the topic and can prime our understanding of the concept.

These are also great tools for directing attention.

(And also a great way to create content!)
