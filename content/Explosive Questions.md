# Explosive Questions
These are questions we can ask to take apart the concepts we are presented.

From Adler and Doren, _How to Read a Book_., here are 4 questions:
1. What is the book about as a whole?
2. What is being said in detail and how?
3. Is the book true, in whole or part?
4. Why is it significant?

These questions are also useful in processing our knowledege, particularly before [Knowledge Storage](Knowledge%20Storage.md).

## Trivia
Explosive Questions was sparked by the mental image of an 'engineering assembly' being exploded into its constitutent parts in animations.
