title: "Flow"

Flow is a concept introduced by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi.

Flow is a state where our skill level to perform a task matches the complexity of the task we have to complete. In a flow state, our entire attention is focused on the topic at hand.

## Entering Flow
If our skill level exceeds the complexity of the task at hand, we get bored.
If our skill level falls short, we get frustrated.

Using principles of [Game Design](Game%20Design.md), we can alter the experience to be more difficult or easier, depending on what we want to achieve.
