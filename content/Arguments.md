# Arguments
Arguments are the fundamental building blocks of [Reasoning](Reasoning.md).

Arguments provide [reasons](Reasoning.md) why you should accept a given [Proposition](Proposition.md).


Arguments start with [Assumptions](Assumptions.md) or [Axioms](Axioms.md) and are built step by step using [propositions](Proposition.md), other arguments and self-evident facts.

Good arguments can be summarized succinctly.
