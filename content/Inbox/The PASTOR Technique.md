# The PASTOR Technique

I learned this from Ray Edwards, while studying [Direct Response Copywriting](Direct%20Response%20Copywriting). Each letter in PASTOR stands for a section in a piece of communication - blog post, email, [Sales Letters](Inbox/Sales%20Letters.md), video etc.

## Elements of PASTOR
### P: Person, Problem & Pain.
- You talk about the person, the problem they have and the pain it causes - in detail. In fact, the more accurate you are, the more your audience will feel you must have an answer to their problem.
- Use this to establish empathy, develop authority and join the conversation that is already taking place in their minds.

### A: Amplify & Aspirations
- Amplify the cost of not solving their problem. Get a dollar cost on to it.
- Then, show them aspirations - paradise that they could be in, once they have used your product.

### S: Story, Solution & System
- Tell the story of how you (or someone you helped) solved the problem using the solution/system.

### T: Transformation & Testimony
- People buy the transformation, so sell the transformation.
- Give proof.
- Make sure you address the internal resistance questions your customers face:
	- Has this guy done what he claims?
	- Has this guy taught others?
	- Can this guy teach me?

### O: Offer
- This is the thing you are offering for sale.
- Focus on the transformation.
- Tie the deliverables back to the transformation and benefits the buyers will receive.

### R: Response
- Ask for the sale.
