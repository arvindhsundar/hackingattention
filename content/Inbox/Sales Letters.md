# Sales Letters
Any piece of persuasive copy that you use to get [Sales](Inbox/Sales.md). It can be in a landing page, an email, a video - any piece of communication (with minor adjustments to suit the medium).

## Parts of a Sales Letter
The Sales Letter has 15 parts, each fitting into [The PASTOR Technique](Inbox/The%20PASTOR%20Technique.md).

### 1. Pre-Head
A short sentence fragment used to grab attention from your ideal prospect.

Example: 
```
Attention: Pug Owners!
```

### 2. Headline
It's the ad for the rest of the ad, and its job is to  make the reader want to keep reading.

Example: 
```
They all laughed when I sat down at the piano. But when I started to play...
```

### 3. Deck Copy
Copy that comes between the headline and the rest of the letter. Reinforces the headline and arouses more curiosity.

Example: ```

```
## Revealed on this page...
- The crucial abc misconception...
- The system meltdown:
- Yours FRREE - Exclusive Access To A Once In A Lifetie Teaching series...
```

### 4. Lead
The part of the letter where you clearly define who this letter is for and what they stand to gain from it.

Sometimes it's a series of "If, then" statements. Sometimes, it's a story designed to make you think a certain way.

Example:

```
If you've done a...
If you've done b...
If you've done c...
and you still have not managed to do d...

then you're about to read the letter you've been waiting for all your life. Here's why...
```

### 5. Body
This is the bulk of the sales letter, built with the elements that follow.

#### A Note on Research
Prospects never read anything at first; they never believe anything at first; and they never buy anything at first.

Your copy needs to: 
1. Get them to read.
2. Help them overcome their skepticism and fear  that causes them to object
3. Ask for the sale.

### 6. Subheads
These are scannable headings that lead the reader through the body of the letter. They should communicate the [gist](Unity%20and%20Complexity.md) of your message upon scanning.

When people [scan content](scan%20content), your headline and subheads should persuade the buyer to read the whole letter.

### 7. Rapport
This is where you show the buyer that you know them, their pain and the problem they face.

People will like you if you:
1. Show that you're like your buyer.
2. Show that you're who they want to be.
3. Show that you like them.

### 8. Bullets
Brief statements that arouse curiosity.

### 9. Credibility
It's the section where you [Signal](Signal.md) your [Proof](Proof.md) to your buyers. You use this to address your buyers' [Fear](Fear) - often with a Subhead that says "Who Am I and Why Should You Listen To Me?"

### 10. Testimonials
Testimonials are [Proof](Proof.md) that your solution works. Unscripted video testimonials with low production value are the best.

If you don't have testimonials, use relevant quotes of famous people, articles, credible sources.

### 11. Value Justification
This is where you show how the value you're putting out compares extremely favourably to the final price of the offer.

Logically derive a dollar value for the offer you're selling. Ideally, the value should be 10x the price.

### 12. Risk Reversal
This is where remove any sense of risk our buyer is feeling by addressing the fears they have.

Show how you're removing risk from them and putting it onto your shoulders.

### 13. Bonuses
A related but UNEXPECTED gift that makes your offer more valuable. This could be the extra nudge that makes a prospect a customer.

### 14. CTA or Explicit Offer
Here's where we ask for the sale and tell the reader what to do to buy our offer.

### 15. P.S.
This is one place buyers will read while scanning. Use this to sum up your biggest benefit and offer a link to purchase.
