title: "Atomic Idea"
---
An Atomic Idea is the fundamental unit of understanding and [Learning](Learning.md) - the permanently understandable note. [My Learning Process](My%20Learning%20Process.md) involves the creation of Atomic Ideas in the [Translation](Translation.md) and [Rebuild](Rebuild.md) phases.

By extension, Atomic Ideas are connected by [Relationships](Relationships.md) to form my [Mesh of Understanding](Mesh%20of%20Understanding.md).


>[!Open questions]
>- What is the relationship between [Working Resolution](Working%20Resolution.md) and Atomic Ideas? 
>- Does the atomicity of the idea change with the working resolution?
