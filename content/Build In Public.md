---

Build In Public is a movement where you are open and vulnerable as you learn and/or create something in public.

The predominant tone of this style of content marketing is that of you chatting with your classmates and friends.

The key principles here are: 
1. Show your work.
2. Adopt a learner's mindset, not an expert lens.
3. Be relatable.
4. Involve your audience in the creation of the product/service.
5. Everything is marketing.
6. Being vulnerable helps.
7. Build a community, not an audience.
8. Have opinions.
9. Project your personality.
10. Build trust.


Trivia: Omakase is a great example of a build in public experience.
