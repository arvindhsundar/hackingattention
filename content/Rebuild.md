# Rebuild
Once you've broken down a [[Concept]] or an element of [[Discovery]] into [[Atomic Ideas]], you need to put it back together, piece by piece, to see if you can rebuild the whole.

This helps us discover and confirm the [[Relationships]] that exist between the [[Atomic Ideas|nodes]].

Doing this rebuilding ensures that we've understood both the [[Unity and Complexity]] of the ideas at hand.
