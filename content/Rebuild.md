title: "Rebuild"
---
Once we've broken down a [Concept](Concept.md) or an element of [Discovery](Discovery.md) into [Atomic Idea](Atomic%20Idea.md)s, you need to put it back together, piece by piece, to see if you can rebuild the whole.

This helps us discover and confirm the [Relationships](Relationships.md) that exist between the [Atomic Idea](Atomic%20Idea.md)s.

Doing this rebuilding ensures that we've understood both the [Unity and Complexity](Unity%20and%20Complexity.md) of the ideas at hand and that [Learning](Learning.md) has actually happened.
