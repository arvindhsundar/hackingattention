# Rebuild
Once you've broken down a [Concept](Concept.md) or an element of [Discovery](Discovery.md) into [Atomic Ideas](Atomic%20Ideas.md), you need to put it back together, piece by piece, to see if you can rebuild the whole.

This helps us discover and confirm the [Relationships](Relationships.md) that exist between the [nodes](Atomic%20Ideas.md).

Doing this rebuilding ensures that we've understood both the [Unity and Complexity](Unity%20and%20Complexity.md) of the ideas at hand.
