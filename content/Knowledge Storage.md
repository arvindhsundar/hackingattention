title: "Knowledge Storage"

Knowledge Storage is a step of [My Learning Process](My%20Learning%20Process.md) where I add an [Atomic Idea](Atomic%20Idea.md) to a relevant place in our [Mesh of Understanding](Mesh%20of%20Understanding.md).

## How To Store Ideas In Your Understanding Mesh
1. Make sure you have an [Atomic Idea](Atomic%20Idea.md) that fits your current [Working Resolution](Working%20Resolution.md).
2. Go through your [Mesh of Understanding](Mesh%20of%20Understanding.md) and identify which nodes you can connect the current Atomic Idea to. [Explosive Questions](Explosive%20Questions.md) will be useful in identifying these notes.
3. Add the note/node/atomic idea to the mesh and connect it to the relevant nodes.
