# Knowledge Storage
Knowledge Storage is a step of [Learning](Learning.md) where we add an [Atomic Ideas](Atomic%20Ideas.md) to a relevant place in our [Mesh of Understanding](Mesh%20of%20Understanding.md).

## How To Store Ideas In Your Understanding Mesh
1. Make sure you have an [Atomic Idea](Atomic%20Ideas.md) or a [Concept](Concept.md) that fits your current [Working Resolution](Working%20Resolution.md).
2. Go through your [Mesh of Understanding](Mesh%20of%20Understanding.md) and identify which nodes you can connect the current idea to. [Explosive Questions](Explosive%20Questions.md) will be useful here.
3. Add the note/node/atomic idea to the mesh and connect it to the relevant nodes.
