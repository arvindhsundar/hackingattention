# How To Read A Book
In "How To Read A Book" (Adler, Mortimer J., and Charles Van Doren. _How to Read a Book_. Simon and Schuster, 1972.), there are several types of [Reading](Reading.md) outlined.

At the first level of reading, the "Elementary Reading" we understand that there are words and they have meaning. 

At the second level, we perform an "Inspectional Reading" - a superficial and systematic skimming - with the primary goal of learning what the book is about. Without skimming, we will attempt to understand both [the forest & the trees](Unity%20and%20Complexity.md) simultaneously.

At the third level, called "Analytical Reading", we begin to have a [conversation with the book](Active%20Consumption.md), usually by means of [Explosive Questions](Explosive%20Questions.md).

At the fourth and final level, "Syntopical Reading", we use our reading experience to understand the broader topic better - we're refining the [Working Resolution](Working%20Resolution.md) of the space.

There are numerous rules that have been set out as well.

## Rules of Reading
