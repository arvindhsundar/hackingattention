title: "inflection point"
---
A point in a story where it undergoes a mutation or variation. In storytelling, these can correlate to story beats and are often created by the [Pacing](Pacing.md) of the story.

A fast paced story would have multiple inflection points in rapid succession.
A slow story would have fewer.
