title: "Mesh of Understanding"

My Mesh of Understanding is a network of [Atomic Idea](Atomic%20Idea.md)s connected by [Relationships](Relationships.md). 

## Mesh of Understanding vs. Knowledge Mesh
Wikipedia is a knowledge mesh. It contains different pieces of knowledge connected to other pieces of knowledge. Just because I know that A is connected to B, does not mean I understand the relationship.

The content is divorced from the context & meaning.

The difference between and Mesh of Understanding and a Knowledge Mesh is that of context. In an Mesh of Understanding, I am aware of the [Relationships](Relationships.md) that exist between two or more [Atomic Idea](Atomic%20Idea.md)s.


## Using Gaps In The Mesh
Sometimes, our understanding mesh is incomplete.

That's good news. We can:
- Use the gap as the direction for [Discovery](Discovery.md)
- Look at the whole topic at a finer [Working Resolution](Working%20Resolution.md)


## Trivia
This idea came to me when I was fooling around with proportional editing of nodes in Blender for 3D modelling.
