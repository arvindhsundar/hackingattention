# Mesh of Understanding
An Understanding mesh is a network of [Atomic Ideas](Atomic%20Ideas.md) connected by [Relationships](Relationships.md). It can also be an abstraction of the way our [brain](brain) stores information in [models](Models.md).

## Mesh of Understanding vs. Knowledge Mesh
Wikipedia is a knowledge mesh. It contains different pieces of knowledge connected to other pieces of knowledge. Just because I know that A is connected to B, does not mean I understand the relationship.

In other words, the difference between and Mesh of Understanding and a Knowledge Mesh is that in an Mesh of Understanding, I am aware of the [Relationships](Relationships.md) that exist between two or more [Atomic Ideas](Atomic%20Ideas.md).


## Using Gaps In The Mesh
Sometimes, our understanding mesh is incomplete.

That's alright. We can still:
- Use the gap as the direction for [further exploration](Discovery.md).
- Look at the whole topic at a lower [resolution](Working%20Resolution.md)


## Trivia
This idea came to me when I was fooling around with proportional editing of nodes in Blender for 3D modelling.
