This is an opportunity to reinforce the desire the prospect has for the benefits they desire.</li><li>Integrate your USP (unique selling proposition) into the language of the guarantee itself. The very qualities that make you and your offer unique and appealing should be woven into your guarantee.</li><li>Personalize the guarantee. Make it more than a guarantee – make it a personal promise from the company spokesperson, or business persona.</li><li>Give the longest guarantee possible. Tests have shown that longer guarantees result in lower refund rates.</li><li>Demonstrate that returns are easy and hassle-free. Remove the fears and misgivings people have about how tough it will be to get a refund if they want one.</li><li>Assure them that this is a no-strings attached, unconditional guarantee. It’s easy to deal with the very well-known assumptions customers have about the “hassle factor.”</li><li>Emphasize the speed of refunds. Show that refunds will happen very quickly.</li><li>Amaze them with what I call the “I’ll-take-the-risk twist.” Show the prospect that you, not they, are shouldering the risk.</li><li>Give your guarantee a name. Naming it makes it real, makes it unique, and differentiates your guarantee from those of your competitors.</li></ol><p>◆ 8 How to Write Copy That Closes the Deal</p><p>▪ There are a bunch of things that happen in the close that you may not be aware of or may not realize are part of your closing copy</p><p>▪ First, recap the offer</p><p>▪ You want to be sure to forge the chain of logic you use to make it reasonable to them that they should buy your offer</p><p>▪ in your closing copy, drive home the benefits and the “big reason why</p><p>▪ the most important thing in your closing copy is that you must ask for the sale</p><p>▪ Your transitional copy moves the reader out of the main sales copy and into the close</p><p>▪ 5 Closing Copy Templates That Work</p><ol><li>The “You Will Certainly Arrive” Close. The metaphor is, we both know you’re going to arrive, the question is where? I purposefully leave that question open for them to answer, I don’t answer that for them because I want them to have the answer it’s more powerful that way.</li><li>The “Different Results” Close. If you want different results you need to do something different. Make a definitive decision right now to get different results.</li><li>The “Crossroads” Close. This close invokes language that’s deeply embedded in our subconscious, which is from the poem by Robert Frost about the road not taken. “I chose the road less traveled, and it has made all the difference.”</li><li>The “Decision Time” Close. It’s in your moments of decision that your destiny is shaped. What will you decide to do right now?</li><li>The “Handholding” Close. You’re metaphorically holding their hand. Show them what that will look like, and be careful that you don’t create false expectations.</li></ol><p>◆ 9 How to Write Irresistible Offers</p><p>▪ The Offer is the core of your sales copy. It consists of:
• The benefit of what you’re selling (the transformation).
• The vehicle or mechanism that delivers the transformation.
• The price & payment terms.</p><p>▪ CHARTER OFFER</p><p>▪ O.P.E.N. is my acronym describing the difference stages of buying awareness.</p><p>▪ you sell them what they want and in the meantime you deliver what they need</p><p>▪ The 9 Kinds of Offers
OFFER #1 – Hard offer. This doesn’t mean it’s difficult, it simply means it’s straightforward and there are no fuzzy edges. This is what you get.
OFFER #2 – Soft offer. This is the kind of offer that usually involves language like, “Send no money now. We’ll send you the kit, shirt, glasses (or whatever) for you to try for 30 days and if you like it we’ll automatically charge bill you.”
OFFER #3 – Charter offer. This should look familiar to you because you’ve seen it many times before. It’s the first time ever that a product is being offered, and so it’s offered at a charter price or rate that nobody will ever get again in the future.
OFFER #4 – Limited supply offer. This just means there are a specific number of available units or positions.
OFFER #5 – Limited time offer. This sounds similar to offer #4, but it’s a little different because it’s not about the units or positions in the class, it’s good for a specific limited time period.
OFFER #6 – The application offer. This is an elite offer. You make people apply for the privilege of buying your product. (Don’t laugh this works like crazy).
OFFER #7 – The payment plan offer. This makes it easier to sell higher ticket items because people don’t have to pay all at once up front.
OFFER #8 – The one-time offer. You’ve probably seen this before, it’s usually an upsell or add-on sale.
OFFER #9 – The negative option offer. It’s also known as forced continuity. This is where people buy something and they get a subscription that goes along with the thing they bought.</p><p>◆ 10 The Secrets of Product Launch Copy</p><p>▪ activities—launches, promotions, and story selling—are inextricably intertwined in my mind.

The best and most successful movie trailers do three things without fail:</p><ol><li>Give you the Dominant Story Idea (DSI)</li><li>Offer a sample of the feelings you’ll get from the movie itself</li><li>Provide proof that the movie “works”
