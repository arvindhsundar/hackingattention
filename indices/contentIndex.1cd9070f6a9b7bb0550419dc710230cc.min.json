{"/":{"title":"Hacking Attention","content":"\nHi! I'm Arvindh Sundar, and welcome to Hacking Attention.\n\nThis site is a collection of my notes as I explore the answers to two questions that have been central to my career and personal life:\n\n\u003e 1. What does it take to capture, hold and direct attention?\n\u003e 2. How can we retain control over our attention?\n\nApart from these answers, there will be tangents that I find interesting, giving a chance for happy little accidents.\n\nI invite you to see where my explorations have taken me. Start by visiting my [Areas of Exploration](Areas%20of%20Exploration.md).\n\nAnd, if you want to reach me, hit me up on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/arvindhsundar).\n\nWith love from Bengaluru, this is Arvindh saying over and out.","lastmodified":"2022-10-13T08:42:05.230673974Z","tags":null},"/Areas-of-Exploration":{"title":"Areas of Exploration","content":"\nThese are the areas I'm planning to explore in [Hacking Attention](https://hackingattention.com)\n\nStorytelling\nGamification\nCopywriting\nVideo Creation\nCommunity Building\nFunnel Design\nPropaganda Design\nPSYOPs\nExperience Design\nEmployee Engagement\nBuilding In Public\nReligious Leadership\nToastmasters\nPublic Speaking\nStand up Comedy\nMagic\nWeb3 Community Building\nGame design\nEmail marketing\nCold Email Marketing\nInfluencers\nNegotiation Specialists\nLearning Design","lastmodified":"2022-10-13T08:42:05.230673974Z","tags":null}}
