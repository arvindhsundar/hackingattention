{"/":{"title":"Hacking Attention","content":"\nHi! I'm Arvindh Sundar, and welcome to Hacking Attention.\n\nThis site is a collection of my notes as I explore the answers to two questions that have been central to my career and personal life:\n\n\u003e 1. What does it take to capture, hold and direct attention?\n\u003e 2. How can we retain control over our attention?\n\nApart from these answers, there will be tangents that I find interesting, giving a chance for happy little accidents. I invite you to see where my explorations have taken me.\n\nA few pointers:\n- The notes are written for me. The detail depends on my preferred [Working Resoultion](Working%20Resoultion.md) or interest in the topic.\n- The notes will change over time.\n- Some of you may prefer to see my [Areas of Exploration](Areas%20of%20Exploration.md)\n\nIf you want to reach me, hit me up on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/arvindhsundar).\n\nWith love from Bengaluru, this is Arvindh saying over and out.","lastmodified":"2022-10-15T16:04:21.466905547Z","tags":null},"/Areas-of-Exploration":{"title":"Areas of Exploration","content":"\nThese are the areas I'm planning to explore in [Hacking Attention](https://hackingattention.com)\n\n- [Storytelling](Storytelling.md)\n- Gamification\n- Copywriting\n- Video Creation\n- Community Building\n- Funnel Design\n- Propaganda Design\n- PSYOPs\n- Experience Design\n- Employee Engagement\n- Building In Public\n- Religious Leadership\n- Toastmasters\n- Public Speaking\n- Stand up Comedy\n- Magic\n- Web3 Community Building\n- Game design\n- Email marketing\n- Cold Email Marketing\n- Influencers\n- Negotiation Specialists\n- Learning Design\n- Makeup Artists\n- Sale","lastmodified":"2022-10-15T16:04:21.466905547Z","tags":null},"/Inflection-point":{"title":"inflection point","content":"Q: Do inflection points appear in experiences too or are they limited to stories?\nQ: Are all experiences stories?","lastmodified":"2022-10-15T16:04:21.466905547Z","tags":null},"/Storytelling":{"title":"Storytelling","content":"Storytelling is an artform as old as civilization. \n\nVarious frameworks for storytelling exist, with each story beat focusing on a specific [Inflection point](Inflection%20point.md) in the story.\n\nCreators use the structures/formulae for stories as audiences are subconsciously comfortable with the structure - and subconsciously give the story attention. \n\nThat's why Kung Fu Panda \u0026 Harry Potter \u0026 The Matrix have similar plotlines.\n\nHowever, many people [complain](complain.md) that using a formula or framework for storytelling kills [creativity](creativity.md).\n\nThe fact that a formula exists also means that a creator can use a twist to subvert that expectation - and use [surprise](surprise.md) to gain attention.","lastmodified":"2022-10-15T16:04:21.466905547Z","tags":null},"/Working-Resoultion":{"title":"Working Resoultion","content":"In any situation, there is a threshold of information required for meaningful engagement, defined by the context in which we are operating. \n\nIf the information we have falls short, we cannot engage effectively. If we have excessive information, we may not use it - or worse, get detracted.\n\nThis threshold of information is called The Working Resolution.\n\nThe Working Resolution changes from task to task, depending on the context in which we are operating.\n\n\n## Example of Working Resolution\nTo drive a car, we don't need to know how a car is built.\n\nTo build a car, we don't need to know how steel is made.","lastmodified":"2022-10-15T16:04:21.466905547Z","tags":null},"/complain":{"title":"complain","content":"Complaining is a mechanism to gain attention.","lastmodified":"2022-10-15T16:04:21.466905547Z","tags":null},"/creativity":{"title":"creativity","content":"Q: What's the relationship between creativity and attention?","lastmodified":"2022-10-15T16:04:21.466905547Z","tags":null},"/surprise":{"title":"surprise","content":"When the brain expects something and doesn't receive it, surprise is created.\n\nHumour, shock, twists and reframing are all techniques to create surprise.","lastmodified":"2022-10-15T16:04:21.466905547Z","tags":null}}
