{"/":{"title":"Hacking Attention","content":"\nHi! I'm Arvindh Sundar, and welcome to Hacking Attention.\n\nThis site is a collection of my notes as I explore the answers to two questions that have been central to my career and personal life:\n\n\u003e 1. What does it take to capture, hold and direct attention?\n\u003e 2. How can we retain control over our attention?\n\nApart from these answers, there will be tangents that I find interesting, giving a chance for happy little accidents. I invite you to see where my explorations have taken me.\n\nA few pointers:\n- The notes are written for me. The detail depends on my preferred [[Working Resoultion]] or interest in the topic.\n- The notes will change over time.\n- Some of you may prefer to see my [Areas of Exploration](Areas%20of%20Exploration.md)\n\nIf you want to reach me, hit me up on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/arvindhsundar).\n\nWith love from Bengaluru, this is Arvindh saying over and out.","lastmodified":"2022-10-14T11:33:10.962794227Z","tags":null},"/Areas-of-Exploration":{"title":"Areas of Exploration","content":"\nThese are the areas I'm planning to explore in [Hacking Attention](https://hackingattention.com)\n\n- Storytelling\n- Gamification\n- Copywriting\n- Video Creation\n- Community Building\n- Funnel Design\n- Propaganda Design\n- PSYOPs\n- Experience Design\n- Employee Engagement\n- Building In Public\n- Religious Leadership\n- Toastmasters\n- Public Speaking\n- Stand up Comedy\n- Magic\n- Web3 Community Building\n- Game design\n- Email marketing\n- Cold Email Marketing\n- Influencers\n- Negotiation Specialists\n- Learning Design","lastmodified":"2022-10-14T11:33:10.962794227Z","tags":null},"/Working-Resoultion":{"title":"Working Resoultion","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-10-14T11:33:10.962794227Z","tags":null}}
