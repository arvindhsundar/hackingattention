(don't state the benefit. describe it.)\n\n▪ Give me (X), and I’ll give you (Y).\n\n▪ In this bullet type, you’re giving the prospect something easy for him or her to do or comply with, and you’re associating it to a more valuable benefit.\n\n▪ This works especially well with any controversial question or issue that is hotly debated. Find an issue where the controversy is well-known in your market.\n\n▪ Use this type of bullet when you have a superior benefit that you can prove\n\n▪ Just make sure you actually have the “single most” whatever-it-is you’re touting. This is an effective way to talk about it. I guarantee if your product is the superior product in its category, you’ll have the opportunity to use at least three or four “single most” bullets within your overall copy.\n\n▪ Saying “Grow more and better roses” isn’t a dimensional statement. However, saying “How to grow rose bushes that are literally bursting with mounds of fragrant, colorful, beautiful blooms, with less effort and in less time” dimensionalizes that particular benefit bullet\n\n▪ Any time you use the how-to bullet, make sure you’re using a few more specifics and make it more real, more tangible to the reader.\n\n▪ Use this when you have a specific number of techniques or multiple ways of doing a certain thing, multiple reasons why, or multiple reasons why not\n\n▪ confirm a suspicion that your reader already has\n\n▪ we all love it when other people throw rocks at our enemies and confirm our suspicions.

You want to present worst case scenarios to set these particular kinds of bullets up\n\n▪ The “what” bullet simply answers the question “What?\n\n▪ You simply start by stating what one should never do, and then you follow that up with the possible consequences of the reader ignoring this brilliant “what never” advice.\n\n▪ Use this particular kind of bullet when you believe your readers are doing something that is a mistake. Something that your product, service, or information will help them avoid\n\n▪ the “reason why” bullet is copy that hides the reason why.\n\n▪ If you have an unusual solution, device, tactic, or method, then you can use this bullet to build curiosity.\n\n▪ Ask a question you are reasonably certain you know the answer to\n\n▪ sit down and write five or ten of each of these bullets for your product\n\n◆ 6 The Triad That Sells More: Irresistible Offers, Risk Reversal, and Powerful Closes\n\n▪ the triad of selling—the offer, the close, and the risk reversal segment\n\n▪ Construct your offer so it’s like a miniature sales letter\n\n▪ Apply the P.A.S.T.O.R. Framework™ to your offer.\n\n▪ Enclose your order area copy in a differentiating text box.\n\n▪ Give your prospects the words to say inside their own minds.\n\n▪ You are thinking thoughts for the reader\n\n▪ Focus on the outcome your reader desires and use language that aspires to that outcome, to gain the emotional state or the sense of being that this outcome will give them.\n\n▪ Use credit card logos and secure site symbols.\nWhy is this important? These are symbols that we’ve been trained to accept as trustworthy, reliable, and stable. By including them, you are reassuring your prospect that your site shares the same qualities\n\n▪ This is all inside the offer box.\n\n▪ Use both an order button and a text link (such as “click to order”\n\n▪ the biggest fear prospects have when they come to your website is the fear that you are going to rip them off\n\n▪ I really want you to get—deep in your bones—the fact that risk reversal is exactly what it says. It’s not some semantic trick of language; it truly is reversal of risk.\n\n▪ Put your risk reversal inside a certificate\n\n▪ Just describe the benefits in your guarantee or risk reversal language.\n\n▪ Keep selling even in your guarantee section\n\n▪ Use active language to dimensionalize your guarantee.\n\n▪ A video of you personally delivering the guarantee is more powerful than text alone.\n\n▪ If a signature works, a handwritten guarantee often works even better.\n\n▪ The “close” is you asking for the order.\n\n▪ You want to use urgency, scarcity, and reward.\n\n▪ Tell your reader what to do to close the deal\n\n▪ Reassure and praise your reader for the good decision he or she made\n\n▪ Tell them exactly what’s going to happen when they press the “Submit” or “Buy now” button. This is a question your reader is wondering about.\n\n▪ Your order form should look exactly like your website.\n\n▪ Test your order form\n\n◆ 7 How to Write Guarantees That Dissolve Fear and Unleash a River of Sales\n\n▪ preponderance\n\n▪ You’ve crafted powerful bullet points that appeal to every possible tiny variation of every benefit, and answering every objection before it’s raised.\n\n▪ We need to remove fear, so that people are free to buy\n\n▪ The buyer’s safest default position is to not believe you without proof\n\n▪ They hate hassle more than they fear losing money\n\n▪ Buyers hate stress more than they fear losing money.\n\n▪ Buyers hate looking foolish more than they fear losing money\n\n▪ Buyers hate feeling foolish even more than looking foolish\n\n▪ Your guarantee (or risk-reversal) has to not only guarantee their money back, but it must dispel fear.\n\n▪ Ray’s Way 10-Part Guarantee Formula\n1. Start with the words “100% unconditional money back guarantee.” For some people this is required “code language” that signals they are safe in making the transaction.\n2. Sell your benefits and transformation in the guarantee itself. This is an opportunity to reinforce the desire the prospect has for the benefits they desire.\n3. Integrate your USP (unique selling proposition) into the language of the guarantee itself. The very qualities that make you and your offer unique and appealing should be woven into your guarantee.\n4. Personalize the guarantee. Make it more than a guarantee – make it a personal promise from the company spokesperson, or business persona.\n5. Give the longest guarantee possible. Tests have shown that longer guarantees result in lower refund rates.\n6. Demonstrate that returns are easy and hassle-free. Remove the fears and misgivings people have about how tough it will be to get a refund if they want one.\n7. Assure them that this is a no-strings attached, unconditional guarantee. It’s easy to deal with the very well-known assumptions customers have about the “hassle factor.”\n8. Emphasize the speed of refunds. Show that refunds will happen very quickly.\n9. Amaze them with what I call the “I’ll-take-the-risk twist.” Show the prospect that you, not they, are shouldering the risk.\n10. Give your guarantee a name. Naming it makes it real, makes it unique, and differentiates your guarantee from those of your competitors.\n\n◆ 8 How to Write Copy That Closes the Deal\n\n▪ There are a bunch of things that happen in the close that you may not be aware of or may not realize are part of your closing copy\n\n▪ First, recap the offer\n\n▪ You want to be sure to forge the chain of logic you use to make it reasonable to them that they should buy your offer\n\n▪ in your closing copy, drive home the benefits and the “big reason why\n\n▪ the most important thing in your closing copy is that you must ask for the sale\n\n▪ Your transitional copy moves the reader out of the main sales copy and into the close\n\n▪ 5 Closing Copy Templates That Work\n1. The “You Will Certainly Arrive” Close. The metaphor is, we both know you’re going to arrive, the question is where? I purposefully leave that question open for them to answer, I don’t answer that for them because I want them to have the answer it’s more powerful that way.\n2. The “Different Results” Close. If you want different results you need to do something different. Make a definitive decision right now to get different results.\n3. The “Crossroads” Close. This close invokes language that’s deeply embedded in our subconscious, which is from the poem by Robert Frost about the road not taken. “I chose the road less traveled, and it has made all the difference.”\n4. The “Decision Time” Close. It’s in your moments of decision that your destiny is shaped. What will you decide to do right now?\n5. The “Handholding” Close. You’re metaphorically holding their hand. Show them what that will look like, and be careful that you don’t create false expectations.\n\n◆ 9 How to Write Irresistible Offers\n\n▪ The Offer is the core of your sales copy. It consists of:\n• The benefit of what you’re selling (the transformation).\n• The vehicle or mechanism that delivers the transformation.\n• The price \u0026 payment terms.\n\n▪ CHARTER OFFER\n\n▪ O.P.E.N. is my acronym describing the difference stages of buying awareness.\n\n▪ you sell them what they want and in the meantime you deliver what they need\n\n▪ The 9 Kinds of Offers\nOFFER #1 – Hard offer. This doesn’t mean it’s difficult, it simply means it’s straightforward and there are no fuzzy edges. This is what you get.\nOFFER #2 – Soft offer. This is the kind of offer that usually involves language like, “Send no money now. We’ll send you the kit, shirt, glasses (or whatever) for you to try for 30 days and if you like it we’ll automatically charge bill you.”\nOFFER #3 – Charter offer. This should look familiar to you because you’ve seen it many times before. It’s the first time ever that a product is being offered, and so it’s offered at a charter price or rate that nobody will ever get again in the future.\nOFFER #4 – Limited supply offer.

This sounds similar to offer #4, but it’s a little different because it’s not about the units or positions in the class, it’s good for a specific limited time period.\nOFFER #6 – The application offer.

I don’t think you can separate the three.\n\n▪ . Will it be a full launch, one that’s going to last over a period of several weeks from beginning to end? Are you going to do a compressed launch, which might be a process of launching your product over a week to ten days, or are you going to do a mini-launch, which could be more like a promotion that takes place over one to three days?\n\n▪ a product launch consists of a sequence of marketing events that form a story\n\n▪ Your next step is to “map out” your launch. Plan it on a calendar, even if you’re doing just a promotion, not a “full” launch\n\n▪ If you’re marketing on the internet, you’re always doing a product launch\n\n▪ For a full treatment of product launches, I recommend the book Launch! by Jeff Walker.\n\n▪ Reciprocity\n\n▪ Commitment \u0026 Consistency\n\n▪ Liking\n\n▪ Authority\n\n▪ Social Proof\n\n▪ Scarcity\n\n▪ I had a problem, and I figured out a way to solve it. Now, I would like to share with you how I solved that problem.”\n\n▪ People will respond more readily and will do more to get out of pain than to get into pleasure. I\n\n▪ The Secrets of Product Launch Copy\nProduct Launch Copy Uses Psychological “Triggers.” These triggers of influence were identified by Dr. Robert Cialdini in his book, Influence. They are:\n• Reciprocity\n• Commitment \u0026 Consistency\n• Liking\n• Authority\n• Social Proof\n• Scarcity\nLaunch Copy Begins Long Before the Sales Letter. The sales letter may be only 10-20 percent of the actual copy for the launch.\nProduct Launches Are First ... a Story. The most effective way to set the context for a launch is through a story.\n11 Components of Successful Product Launch Copy\n1. List Building. Write copy that starts building a list using a blog.\n2. Survey. As your list and traffic grow, start asking your market what bugs them; And their pain.\n3. Product. Think of your product as copy.\n4. JV Recruitment. Your first sale is to your joint venture partners.\n5. Pre-Launch Copy. Begin building the feelings of anticipation, scarcity, and social proof.\n6. The “Big PDF.” Write a white paper or special report that spells out your platform or USP.\n7. Unpredictable Plot Complications. Be ready to tell the story you didn’t anticipate.\n8. Countdown Copy. Use copy to whip your buyers into a buying frenzy.\n9. Sales Letter. A carefully crafted sales letter is key to the success of your launch.\n10. Post-Launch Week. As much as 30 percent of your sales may come in the week after launch day.\n11. The Missing Piece. Follow up with your buyers and prospects to make your launch into a business.\n\n◆ 11 The Secrets of Writing Blockbuster Copy by Watching Movies\n\n▪ Let me be clear: by the time they’re done with your copy, they need to see that the only way they can reasonably expect to get to that end state is... by using your product.\n\n▪ CHAPTER 11 QUICK SUMMARY\nHow the DSI Transforms Copy from Boring to Blockbuster\nThe best and most successful movie trailers do three things without fail:\n1. Give you the Dominant Story Idea (DSI)\n2. Offer a sample of the feelings you’ll get from the movie itself\n3. Provide proof that the movie “works”\nPutting the DSI to Work in Your Own Copy\nFirst, you need to identify the same three elements used by movie studios to “sell” their movies to the public. So, thinking in terms of your own product:\n1. What’s the Dominant Story Idea of your sales copy? (E.g., “Weird exercise routine provides world’s best workout in just 4 minutes,” or “Collapsing financial markets have produced an overlooked opportunity for investors,” etc.)\n2. What are three ways you can provide Sample Feelings for your readers... so they picture themselves using your product and enjoying its benefits? (E.g., Can you tell them a True But Amazing Story? Show them a brief video? Let them try one of your techniques?)\n3. What are three powerful ways you can Prove Your Product Works?

This is heavily inspired by [[How To Read A Book]], Andy Matuschak's [Evergreen Notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes?stackedNotes=z4SDCZQeRo4xFEQ8H4qrSqd68ucpgE6LU155C), Niklas Luhmann's [Zettelkasten](http://luhmann.surge.sh/communicating-with-slip-boxes) and Sonke Ahrens' [How To Take Smart notes](https://takesmartnotes.com/)\n\n\n## The Process\nMy Note Taking process has 5 steps:\n1. Collecting notes.\n2. Creating notes.\n3. Connecting notes.\n4. Reviewing notes.\n5. Synthesis.\n\n### 1. Collecting Notes\nWhenever an idea or inspiration strikes me, I take \"fleeting notes\" in index cards, my phone, a text file or a handy notebook. \n\nWhenever I consume something interesting, I take \"literature notes\". I also record the bibliographic details.\n\nThis collection of notes happens in the [[Discovery]] phase of my learning process.\n\n### 2. Creating Notes\n\nOnce a day, I process all my fleeting and literature notes to create a [[Atomic Ideas]] for each unique idea I've encountered. This is the [[Teardown]] stage of [[My Learning Process]].\n\nSometimes, these may be [[Concept|concepts]] and sometimes, depending on the [[Working Resolution]], I can break them down to the [[Atomic Ideas]] contained within.\n\nI write it as if I was teaching someone, in my own words. This is the process of [[Translation]], similar to the essence of the [[Feynman Technique]].\n\nThese notes remain in the [[The Inbox]] till they're complete and ready for further action.\n\nOnce processed, I delete the fleeting notes \u0026 archive the literature notes.\n\n### 3. Connecting Notes\nTo connect my [[Atomic Ideas|permanote]] and add it into my second brain, I figure out where it fits into my overall mesh/map of knowledge and the [[Relationships]] to other [[Atomic Ideas|notes]] and [[Concept|concepts]].\n\nThis allows me to [[Rebuild]] my understanding of the [[Atomic Ideas]], the [[Concept]] and the [[Relationships]] that exist within the [[Unity and Complexity]] of the topic at hand.\n\nThe goal is to add value to what I already have - not repeat what I already have/know - i.e. avoid [[Intellectual Regurgitation]].\n\nOnce I've found the right place, I [[Knowledge Storage|add it into my second brain system]] and link it:\n\n1.  To the note it is closest to conceptually with text explaining the [[Relationships]] between the two.\n2.  Link it to other relevant notes as well.\n\nSometimes, if it's a new topic, I'll have to make it an island - a note that's not connected to anything else. \n\n### 4. Reviewing Notes\nPeriodically, I review my second brain, thanks to a recurring calendar event - and a random note plugin in Obsidian. I look at the connections and gaps to ask new questions go down another rabbit hole.\n\nAs my body of notes ([[Mesh of Understanding]]) grows, I will need to create \"staging notes\" which contain links to other \"launchpad notes\" that serve as entry points to a particular sector of knowledge.\n\n### 5. Synthesis\nOnce the body of notes has grown large enough, I'll look for a many notes clustered around a topic. I can then collate those notes to form an outline for a new piece of content. \n\nOnce I have the outline, all I'll need to do is edit that manuscript and publish.\n\n\n## Tools for Note Taking\nThe tools I use for this process are:\n\n1. Index cards or my phone to take fleeting notes.\n2. Sometimes, I use the highlight feature as well in my book reading app for literature notes.\n3. @obsdmd to build my second brain.\n4. @Zotero to maintain bibliographies.\n\n## Links for further exploration\n1.
