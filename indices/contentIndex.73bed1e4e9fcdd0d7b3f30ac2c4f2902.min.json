Collecting notes.\n2. Creating notes.\n3. Connecting notes.\n4. Reviewing notes.\n5. Synthesis.\n\n### 1. Collecting Notes\nWhenever an idea or inspiration strikes me, I take \"fleeting notes\" in index cards, my phone, a text file or a handy notebook. In my digital garden/second brain, I call this [The Inbox](The%20Inbox.md).\n\nWhenever I consume something interesting, I take \"literature notes\". I also record the bibliographic details.\n\nThis collection of notes happens in the [Discovery](Discovery.md) phase of my learning process.\n\n### 2. Creating Notes\nFrequently, I process all my fleeting and literature notes to create an [Atomic Idea](Atomic%20Idea.md) for each unique idea I've encountered. This is the [Teardown](Teardown.md) stage of [My Learning Process](My%20Learning%20Process.md).\n\nSometimes, these may be [Concept](Concept.md)s and sometimes, depending on the [Working Resolution](Working%20Resolution.md), I can break them down to the [Atomic Idea](Atomic%20Idea.md) contained within.\n\nI write it as if I was teaching someone, in my own words. This is the process of [Translation](Translation.md), similar to the essence of the [Feynman Technique](Feynman%20Technique.md).\n\nThese notes remain in the [The Inbox](The%20Inbox.md) till they're ready for further action. In some cases, they live in the second brain with Open Questions noted down for further exploration.\n\nOnce processed, I delete the fleeting notes \u0026 archive the literature notes.\n\n### 3. Connecting Notes\nTo connect my [Atomic Idea](Atomic%20Idea.md) and add it into my second brain, I figure out where it fits into my overall mesh/map of knowledge and the [Relationships](Relationships.md) to other [Atomic Idea](Atomic%20Idea.md)s and [Concept](Concept.md)s.\n\nThis allows me to [Rebuild](Rebuild.md) my understanding of the [Atomic Idea](Atomic%20Idea.md), the [Concept](Concept.md) and the [Relationships](Relationships.md) that exist within the [Unity and Complexity](Unity%20and%20Complexity.md) of the topic at hand.\n\nThe goal is to add value to what I already have - not repeat what I already have/know - i.e. avoid [Intellectual Regurgitation](Intellectual%20Regurgitation.md).\n\nOnce I've found the right place, I add it into my second brain system as a part of [Knowledge Storage](Knowledge%20Storage.md) and link it:\n\n1.  To the note it is closest to conceptually with text explaining the [Relationships](Relationships.md) between the two.\n2.  Link it to other relevant notes as well, usually with a \"see also\"\n\nSometimes, if it's a new topic, I'll have to make it an island - a note that's not connected to anything else. \n\n### 4. Reviewing Notes\nPeriodically, I review my second brain, thanks to a recurring calendar event. I look at the connections and gaps to ask new questions go down another rabbit hole. The Open Questions section also guides further research if I'm so inclined.\n\nAs my body of notes aka [Mesh of Understanding](Mesh%20of%20Understanding.md) grows, I will need to create \"staging notes\" which contain links to other \"launchpad notes\" that serve as entry points to a particular sector of knowledge. [Areas of Exploration](Areas%20of%20Exploration.md) is one such note.\n\n### 5. Synthesis\nOnce the body of notes has grown large enough, I'll look for a many notes clustered around a topic. I can then collate those notes to form an outline for a new piece of content. \n\nOnce I have the outline, all I'll need to do is edit that manuscript and publish. \n\n## Tools for Note Taking\nThe tools I use for this process are:\n\n1. Obsidian or Google Keep to take fleeting notes.\n2. Sometimes, I use the highlight feature as well in my book reading app (Moon Reader) for taking literature notes for processing.\n3. Obsidian \u0026 Quartz to build my second brain.\n\n## Links for further exploration\n1.  Evergreen Notes: https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4SDCZQeRo4xFEQ8H4qrSqd68ucpgE6LU155C\n2.
